# Advent of Code 2022

Here are my advent of code attempts. I've decided to use Python which I am unfamiliar with, so I'm using this as more of a learning opportunity. This also means I'm not trying to find the most optimal way to solve each challenge.

## Challenges

| Day       | Challenge            |
|:---------:|:--------------------:|
| [1](day1) | [Done](day1/day1.py) |
| [2](day2) | [Done](day2/day2.py) |
