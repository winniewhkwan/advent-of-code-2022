# Advent of Code 2022

Here are my advent of code attempts. I've decided to use Python which I am unfamiliar with, so I'm using this as more of a learning opportunity. This also means I'm not trying to find the most optimal way to solve each challenge.

Will be counting part two of the challenge as bonuses.
